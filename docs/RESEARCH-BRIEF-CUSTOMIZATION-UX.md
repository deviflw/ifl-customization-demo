# Research Brief: Luxury Watch Customization Service UX

## üéØ Project Overview

### Company: IFL Watches
**Service:** Premium watch customization
**Market Position:** Luxury customization, not mass market

### Service Offerings:

#### 1. Bespoke Edition ($1,200)
- Customer selects an original luxury watch ($500-$6,000)
- We apply hand-painted custom artwork
- Total: $1,200 service + watch price
- Production: 3-4 weeks

#### 2. Full Customization ($1,490)
- Customer provides inspiration/vision
- Complete custom design creation
- Applied to selected watch model
- Total: $1,490 service + watch price
- Production: 4-5 weeks

## üî¥ The Core Problem

### Traditional E-commerce Template Fails for Services

**Standard Product Page Structure:**
```
[Product Gallery] | [Product Details]
     60%         |      40%
```

**Why This Doesn't Work for Customization Services:**

1. **No Physical Product to Photograph**
   - Service is intangible until completed
   - Can't show "the product" because it doesn't exist yet
   - Portfolio ‚â† Product gallery

2. **Multiple Visual Needs**
   - Show our portfolio/past work
   - Show original watch options
   - Show customization process
   - Show potential outcomes

3. **Mobile Complexity**
   - Configurator needs space
   - Gallery takes prime real estate
   - Users need to see selections + options + inspiration

4. **Google/SEO Constraints**
   - Google Merchant expects product images
   - SEO requires certain structure
   - Can't completely break conventions

## üé® Research Questions

### Primary Research Goals:

1. **How do luxury customization services present their offerings?**
   - Brands to study: $1,000-$5,000 service range
   - Not mass market (no Etsy, no print-on-demand)
   - Actual luxury positioning

2. **Gallery vs. No Gallery Decision**
   - Who uses traditional galleries?
   - Who broke the pattern?
   - What works better for conversion?

3. **Mobile-First Solutions**
   - How handle complex customization on mobile?
   - Where place the configurator?
   - How show inspiration without overwhelming?

4. **Inspiration vs. Product Showcase**
   - How to show portfolio without confusion?
   - When to show what customer selected?
   - How to transition between states?

## üîç Specific Areas to Investigate

### 1. Service Presentation Patterns
- How luxury services differ from product pages
- Alternative layouts that work
- When gallery is removed vs. adapted

### 2. Customization Journey Flows
```
Questions to answer:
- Linear vs. non-linear selection
- When to show price breakdown
- How to handle "no product photo" situation
- Progressive disclosure techniques
```

### 3. Visual Hierarchy Solutions
- What takes hero position if not product gallery?
- How to balance:
  - Inspiration (portfolio)
  - Selection (original watches)
  - Configuration (options)
  - Result (mockup/preview)

### 4. Trust Building Without Product Photos
- How establish credibility
- Social proof placement
- Process visualization
- Quality indicators

## üìä Competitor Categories to Study

### Direct Competitors (Watch Customization)
- Bamford Watch Department
- Titan Black
- MAD Paris
- Blaken
- Project X Designs

### Luxury Customization Services (Non-Watch)
- Nike By You (premium tier)
- Louis Vuitton Mon Monogram
- Burberry Bespoke
- BMW Individual
- Rolls-Royce Bespoke

### Service-First Luxury Brands
- Personal stylists
- Interior designers
- Custom jewelers
- Bespoke tailors
- Art commissioning platforms

## üí° Specific Research Deliverables Needed

### 1. Screenshot Analysis
For each brand studied, capture:
- Desktop full page
- Mobile full page
- Gallery/hero area specifically
- Customization interface
- Mobile menu/navigation
- Checkout/cart representation

### 2. Pattern Documentation
- [ ] Gallery usage (yes/no/modified)
- [ ] Hero content type (static/video/interactive)
- [ ] Customizer placement (inline/modal/separate)
- [ ] Mobile approach (responsive/different/app)
- [ ] Portfolio integration (where/how/when)

### 3. User Flow Mapping
- Entry point ‚Üí Configuration ‚Üí Checkout
- Where decisions happen
- Where inspiration shown
- Where price revealed
- Where trust built

## üéØ Success Metrics to Consider

### What Makes a Good Solution?
1. **Clarity:** User understands what they're buying
2. **Inspiration:** Portfolio visible but not confusing
3. **Configuration:** Easy to make selections
4. **Trust:** Feel confident without seeing final product
5. **Mobile:** Works on small screens without compromise

## üö´ What We Want to Avoid

### Common Pitfalls:
- Forcing service into product template
- Hiding configurator in modals on mobile
- Portfolio confused with product gallery
- Too many visual elements competing
- Unclear what's being purchased

## üìã Research Timeline & Next Steps

### Phase 1: Competitive Analysis (Now)
- Screenshot collection
- Pattern identification
- Best practice extraction

### Phase 2: Prototype Solutions (Next Week)
- Test radical approaches
- A/B test concepts
- Get team feedback

### Phase 3: Implementation (Following Week)
- Build chosen solution
- Test with users
- Iterate based on data

## üí≠ Hypothesis to Test

**Core Hypothesis:**
> "For luxury customization services, the configurator IS the product, 
> and traditional product galleries actually harm conversion by taking 
> focus away from the customization experience."

**Secondary Hypotheses:**
1. Portfolio should be separate section, not in gallery
2. Mobile needs completely different approach than desktop
3. Showing price breakdown builds more trust than hiding it
4. Process visualization > product photography for services

## üìù Additional Context

### Our Constraints:
- Must work with Shopify platform
- Need to maintain brand consistency
- Google Merchant integration required
- No custom backend development
- Must work globally (multiple currencies/languages)

### Our Advantages:
- High price point allows for premium UX
- Educated customer base
- Strong brand reputation
- Quality portfolio to showcase
- Clear service differentiation

## üéØ Final Research Question:

**"How can we design a product page template for a luxury customization service 
that prioritizes the configuration experience over traditional product imagery, 
while maintaining trust, showcasing our portfolio effectively, and working 
within e-commerce platform constraints?"**
