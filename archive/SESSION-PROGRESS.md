# Session Progress - January 2025

## üéØ Current Focus: Portfolio Section

### Research Insights
- **Blaken uses step-by-step Configurator as the product page itself!** ‚ú®
- Split strategy among luxury brands confirmed

## üìç Where We Are Now

### ‚úÖ Completed:
1. Navigation + Breadcrumbs
2. Sticky scroll FIXED 
3. Accordion sections (Description, Shipping, How it Works)
4. Trust badges (2x2 grid)
5. Shipping info removed (was duplicate)
6. robots.txt + noindex (hidden from Google)

### üîÑ Current Task: PORTFOLIO
- Need to implement portfolio section
- Will simulate Shopify metaobjects
- Should be full-width below configurator
- Already have documentation somewhere

## üìÅ Key Files & Locations

### Working Directory:
```
C:/Users/mila/Desktop/ifl-customization-demo
```

### GitHub:
```
https://github.com/deviflw/ifl-customization-demo
```

### Documentation:
- `docs/TECHNICAL-DOCS.md` - Full technical details
- `docs/SERVICE-GALLERY-RESEARCH.md` - Gallery research
- `docs/RESEARCH-BRIEF-CUSTOMIZATION-UX.md` - UX brief

## üé® Design Decisions

### For Bespoke Edition:
- Gallery shows Galaxy Concept
- When watch selected: show preview
- NO TABS (confusing UX)

### For Full Customization:
- **NO GALLERY at top**
- **PORTFOLIO full-width below**
- Configurator is the hero

## üí° Portfolio Implementation Plan

### Metaobject Structure (Shopify simulation):
```javascript
portfolio_items = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: "Galaxy Concept",
    watch_model: "Tissot PRX",
    image: "galaxy-prx.jpg",
    category: "space",
    price: "$1,200"
  },
  // more items...
]
```

### Display Options:
1. Grid layout (3-4 columns desktop)
2. Filter by category
3. Hover effects
4. Click to view details

## üî• Next Steps

1. Find portfolio documentation in main folder
2. Create metaobject structure
3. Build portfolio grid
4. Add filters
5. Make it responsive

## üìù Important Notes

### Colors (CSS Variables):
- Primary: `#081820` (dark navy)
- Secondary: `#40bec1` (tiffany)
- Success: `#28a745`

### Layout:
- Desktop: 62/38 split
- Mobile: single column
- Padding: 20px consistent

### Sticky Works Now:
- Removed `overflow-x: hidden`
- Top: 60px (nav height)
